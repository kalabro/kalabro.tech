Below you will find supporting materials for my lightning talk, "Advent of Frontend Architecture", at the BarcelonaJS meetup.

## Patterns

- [Patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev/) - frontend-friendly book on design patterns
- [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/learning-jsdp/) - supporting materials for the second edition of the book by Addy Osmani
- [Feature-Sliced Design](https://feature-sliced.design/) - opinionated folder structure for bigger frontend projects (alternative to Clean Architecture)

## Practices

### ü•Ç Pair tech concept

Two developers are brainstorming an implementation plan on a call. A good alternative to pair programming in fully remote environments.

### üçª Design it twice

Fully spec out first version of your implementation plan. Put it aside and try to spec out an alternative version. Compare the two to come up with the final version.

### üéä Throw away

Without any thorough planning, go ahead and implement the first quick & dirty version. Throw it away. Spec out a proper implementation plan based on your learnings.

### ü™ê Don't change jobs

Stay on the same project until your own decisions come back to you in the form of poor, unmaintainable code.

## Books

- [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39996759) - my favourite software engineering book
- [Learning Domain-Driven Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57573212-learning-domain-driven-design) - good introduction to DDD ([my review](https://kalabro.tech/learning-domain-driven-design-book/))

## Back story

This talk is based on ["The road to Software Architecture (frontend edition)"](https://kalabro.tech/road-to-software-architecture-frontend-edition/) article and is inspired by [CSS Christmas Calendar](https://csschristmascalendar.com/) website.

_**A little promotion:** If you need a hand on your journey, I'm offering both [free](https://adplist.org/mentors/kate-marshalkina) and [paid](https://topmate.io/kalabro) mentorship sessions._
